# haraganUEx
3D design and fabrication of a "haragan": a simple four-sticks tool to remove mud and dirty.

## Motivation

To design and fabricate useful tools using surrounding waste materials is very motivating and much more to help in a disease,.

In this case we where impacted by a recent water flood, on 29-30th october 2024, at Valencia, Spain. Resulting in more than 200 people dead and
uncountable material wounds. After the flood, they do not have even access to tools to remove the dirty.

After [this new](https://www.levante-emv.com/ribera/2024/11/07/artista-fallero-carcaixent-fabrica-haraganes-dana-valencia-111407203.html), and speaking with friends there, we decided to start the construction of slots (haraganes).

# Design

We have used [Freecad0.22](www.freecad.org) for the 3D design. All the design is parametric, so using the [DynamicData workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/DynamicData_Workbench) you can change all dimensions of the design.

To laser-mark previously the wooden parts easy the mount of each slots, we obtain with Freecad the 2D files to export to cutting software, using the [TechDraw workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/TechDraw_Workbench).
