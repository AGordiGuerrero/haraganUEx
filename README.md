3D design and fabrication of a "haragan": a simple four-sticks tool to remove mud and dirty.

## Motivation

To design and fabricate useful tools using surrounding waste materials is very motivating and much more to help in a disease,.

In this case we where impacted by a recent water flood, on 29-30th october 2024, at Valencia, Spain. Resulting in more than 200 people dead and
uncountable material wounds. After the flood, they do not have even access to tools to remove the dirty.

After [this beautiful new](https://www.levante-emv.com/ribera/2024/11/07/artista-fallero-carcaixent-fabrica-haraganes-dana-valencia-111407203.html), and speaking with friends there, we decided to start the construction of slots (haraganes) to remove water and mud.

## Design

We have used [Freecad0.22](www.freecad.org) for the 3D design. All the design is parametric, so using the [DynamicData workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/DynamicData_Workbench) you can change all dimensions of the design just changing this numbers.

To previously laser-mark the wooden parts to easy the build, we obtain with Freecad the 2D files, to be exported to cutting software, using the [TechDraw workbench](https://wiki.freecad.org/TechDraw_Workbench).

## Fabrication

Because of the arrival of new scientific equipments to the new [Centro Ibérico de Investigaciones en Almacenamiento Energético](www.ciiae.org)
we were offered to save and use the woods from the packages. It was quite heavy and clean
